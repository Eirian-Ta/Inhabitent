Red Academy - Project 4 - Inhabitent Website

Ver 1.0.0

Re-create the website : https://tent.academy.red/journal/

Things that I've learnt after finishing this project using Wordpress:

- writing a plugin
- writing a widget
- creating custom post type
- creating custom taxonomy
- using loops for sorting
- more knowledge on HTML, CSS, Javascript and PHP


Things that I would like to improve for this project:

- DRYer code
- Perfect all the pixels (margin, padding, indent...)
- Make the website responsive to different screen-size
